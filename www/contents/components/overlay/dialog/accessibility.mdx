`Dialog` follows the [WAI-ARIA - Dialog (Modal) Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) for accessibility.

- When the dialog opens, focus is automatically set to the first enabled element, or the element from `initialFocusRef`.
- When the dialog closes, focus returns to the element that was focused before the dialog activated, or the element from `finalFocusRef`.
- Clicking on the overlay closes the dialog.
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the dialog.

Set `aria-haspopup="dialog"` on the element that triggers the dialog to inform the user that the dialog will open.

```tsx live=false
const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()

return (
  <>
    <Button aria-haspopup="dialog" onClick={onOpen}>
      Open Dialog
    </Button>

    <Dialog
      isOpen={isOpen}
      onClose={onClose}
      header="孫悟空"
      cancel="わけない"
      onCancel={onClose}
      success="わける"
      onSuccess={onClose}
    >
      だ…大地よ海よ　そして生きているすべての　みんな…
      このオラにほんのちょっとずつだけ元気をわけてくれ…！！！
    </Dialog>
  </>
)
```

## Keyboard Navigation

When the dialog opens, focus is trapped within it. That is, you cannot focus on elements outside the dialog unless the dialog is closed.

| Key             | Description                                                                                                                                                      | State                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`           | Focuses the next element within the dialog that is not disabled. If it's the last element, focuses the first element within the dialog that is not disabled.     | `isOpen={true}`                       |
| `Shift` + `Tab` | Focuses the previous element within the dialog that is not disabled. If it's the first element, focuses the last element within the dialog that is not disabled. | `isOpen={true}`                       |
| `Escape`        | Closes the dialog.                                                                                                                                               | `isOpen={true}` + `closeOnEsc={true}` |
